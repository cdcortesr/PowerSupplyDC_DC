<<<<<<< HEAD
the switching node area is kept to a reasonable minimum and the PFET peak current is derated to stay
within the recommended temperature rating of the PFET. The RDS(ON) of the PFET determines a portion of the
power dissipation in the PFET. However, PFETs with very low RDS(ON) usually have large values of gate charge.
A PFET with a higher gate charge has a corresponding slower switching speed, leading to higher switching
losses and affecting the PFET power dissipation.
